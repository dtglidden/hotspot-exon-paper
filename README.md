# Scripts used in the Hotspot Exon Paper

This repository holds all R and Python scripts used to generate the figures seen in this paper. There are 5 main subdirectories:
* data: Intermediate datasets are saved/loaded here.
* lib: Common R functions used by several scripts.
* maxent: A mirror of the [Perl MAXENT scripts from the Burge Lab](http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/maxent/Xmaxentscan_scoreseq.html). Slight modifications to input handling were made in order to call MAXENT functions from R.
* plots: Any saved plots are stored here.
* scripts: All R/Python scripts.
